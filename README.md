# Story Point Calculator

### Overview
This web-based tool calculates story points based on weighted criteria including complexity, effort, risk, dependency and duration. It provides options for Low, Medium, and High levels for each category. The calculated points are rounded to the nearest Fibonacci number (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13), offering a standardized estimation metric ideal for agile project management.

### Usage
* Select the appropriate radio buttons for each category (Complexity, Effort, Risk, Dependency, Duration).
* Click on any radio button to calculate and display the estimated story points.
* Results are displayed dynamically, showing the selected criteria and the corresponding story points.

### About

- **Complexity**: Evaluate the complexity of the task. Complexity includes technical challenges, dependencies on other components, and the level of domain knowledge required.
- **Effort**: Estimate the effort required to complete the task. This includes coding, testing, integration, and any other activities necessary to finish the task.
- **Risk**: Consider the level of uncertainty or risk associated with the task. Higher uncertainty may warrant assigning higher story points.
- **Dependencies**: Assess dependencies on other tasks, teams, or external factors that could impact the completion of the task.
- **Duration**: Focus on estimating the ideal effort required to complete the task, not including interruptions, context-switching, or unexpected delays. How much time this task will require? Minutes? Hours? Days?
